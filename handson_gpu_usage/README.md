You will find links to the [presentation](https://www.ux.uis.no/~trygve-e/GPUCoursePresentation.html), and a [web-page](https://www.ux.uis.no/~trygve-e/GPUCourse.html) version including the terminal commands.  

There is also a [recording of the presentation](https://www.ux.uis.no/~trygve-e/GPUCourse1.mp4).  As the screen sharing fell out in the part discussing the terminal commands, a [new recording](https://www.ux.uis.no/~trygve-e/GPUCourse2.mp4) has been made of this part.
